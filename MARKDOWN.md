# ASUS Eee PC 4G ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜² 
## Hello there and welcome to my guthub repository where today I will be informing you about the ASUS Eee PC 4G and why it need more attention and love! :grin: 

The ASUS Eee PC 4G netbook was realesed on October 16, 2007 in ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ (Taiwan) by the company ASUS itself and was shipped to many country to be sold and have lots of popularity, atleats that what everyone thought. Unfortunatley the ASUS Eee PC 4G wasnt the most mindblowing netbook at the time since there were many other netbooks such as when Intel introduced the Classmate PC, and the One Laptop Per Child project unveiled the XO notebook which both were way more popluar and ofcource there were a couple more netbooks but they werent that popular or as good as the ASUS Eee PC 4G.
