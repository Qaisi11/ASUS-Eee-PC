# ASUS Eee PC 4G (701) ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜² 
## Hello there and welcome to my github repository where today I will be informing you about the ASUS Eee PC 4G (701) and why it needs more attention and love! :grin: 
***
> The ASUS Eee PC 4G (701) was realesed on October 16, 2007 in ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ (Taiwan) by the company ASUS itself and was shipped to many countrys ~~to be sold and have lots of popularity~~. Unfortunatley the ASUS Eee PC 4G wasnt the most mindblowing netbook at the time since there were many other netbooks. For example, Intel introduced their Classmate PC, and the One Laptop Per Child project unveiled the XO notebook which both were way more popluar. And ofcource there were a couple more netbooks but they werent that popular or that good compared to the ASUS Eee PC 4G.

> But if I was alive back then, I would get the ASUS Eee PC because it had some nice praphics cards, RAM, a nice proceser(CPU), and a beautifull screen.

> Honestly, in 2007, a computer like that with those specs and a price of 325 USD is very nice and could get you lots of work done. And just think about it, why take other expensive PC's when you can have the ASUS Eee PC (701) for only 325 dollars!!
